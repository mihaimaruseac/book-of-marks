=========

Small application for managing bookmarks.

So far it is experimental coding so that I learn how to properly write a
Haskell project with testing, comments, persistent/acid-state (I chose the
later), GUI design, etc.

Development is erratic, a few commits one day, much more a few weeks later
then a large hiatus while I  work on something else and so on. It all depends
on what I find interesting one day and what can be done (for example, because
right now I cannot use Template-Haskell since I decided to build GHC from HEAD
and it doesn't yet work properly, there will be a long hiatus before I'll work
on this again).
