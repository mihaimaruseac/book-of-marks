Note: This is deprecated, I haven't managed to update it in thime, so there's
no actual software here (at least for now).

Small application for managing bookofmarks.

So far it is experimental coding so that I learn how to properly write a
Haskell project with testing, comments, persistent/acid-state (I chose the
later), GUI design, etc.

Development is erratic, a few commits one day, much more a few weeks later
then a large hiatus while I  work on something else and so on. It all depends
on what I find interesting one day and what can be done.
